📌 Project Title
Fully Functional Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

📖 Objective
Create a fully functional, interactive calculator web application that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project aims to provide hands-on practice with:

DOM manipulation

JavaScript event handling

Input parsing and validation

Keyboard input integration

Error handling in user input and execution

🎯 Features
Simple and responsive user interface

Support for basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), division (÷)

Input parsing and dynamic display updates

Error handling for invalid input and division by zero

Keyboard support for all major calculator actions

Event listeners for buttons and keyboard keys

Clear (C) and backspace (←) functionality

🧱 Tech Stack
HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic, event handling, and DOM operations

🔧 Functional Requirements
HTML Structure:

Display screen for input and output

Number and operator buttons

Equal (=), clear (C), and delete (←) buttons

JavaScript Functionality:

Handle button clicks using addEventListener

Handle keyboard events (e.g., keydown)

Parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions safely

Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid input, dividing by zero)

Display meaningful error messages when needed

🧠 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you'll:

Improve understanding of DOM tree traversal and manipulation

Gain confidence in setting up and managing JavaScript event listeners

Understand input parsing and expression evaluation

Learn best practices for UI responsiveness and error handling

Implement keyboard accessibility
